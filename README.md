# 50 Days of CSS

The (no longer active) 50 Days of CSS, old website [here](http://dailycssimages.com/) was an email challenge. For 10 consecutive weeks, you get an email every day from Monday to Friday with a subject, and you are to make some kind of CSS art related to this subject. E.g., the first day is 'bear' and the last day is 'Party City'.
